## Core Races



### Humans

As you would expect, they've infested every corner of the universe they've managed to get their hands on. English is the de facto standard inter-culture, but anyone expecting to perform trade with other races should learn Galactic Common.

#### Racial Features

* An Extra Edge, to represent their variability.

#### Genetic Modifications

Humans have a thing... Nothing is ever quite good enough. Not even their own genetic makeup. As such they are constantly... fiddling. Unfortunately, there are downsides. Very few genetic modifications can be performed reliably, most require a steady supply of "Soup" to remain healthy (Dependency, SFC 6).

For the Dependency weakness, you may chose any *two* of these:

* (Semi-aquatic) Enhanced Lungs
* (Charisma) Pheromones
* (Environmental Resistance) Radiation, Low Oxygen, Heat, Cold
* (Immune to Disease) Perfect Health
* (Keen Sense) Perfect Vision
* (Keen Sense) Perfect Hearing
* (Low Light Vision) Cat Eyes
* (Pace) Enhanced Stamina
* (Parry) Enhanced Intuition
* (Power Points) Mind Strengthened against psionics. Can be taken twice.
* (Sleep Reduction) The brain has been made to constantly dream. Can be taken twice.
* (Toughness) The body has been made to secrete pain relievers.

For the Dependency weakness, you may choose any *one* of these:

* (Attribute Increase) Physical Enhancement
* (Poisonous Touch) Nail beds secrete a poison.
* (Regeneration) Sold as a variation on Perfect Health.
* (Edge) Discuss with the DM

These alterations are reliable and may be taken in pairs:

* Environmental Resistance, Cold + Environmental Weakness, Heat
* Environmental Resistance, Heat + Environmental Weakness, Cold
* Poor Parry + Sleep Reduction
* Poor Parry + Toughness
* Discuss others with the DM.
