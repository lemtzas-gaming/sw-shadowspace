# Races

## Core Races



### Humans

As you would expect, they've infested every corner of the universe they've managed to get their hands on. English is the de facto standard inter-culture, but anyone expecting to perform trade with other races should learn Galactic Common.

#### Racial Features

* An Extra Edge, to represent their variability.

#### Genetic Modifications

Humans have a thing... Nothing is ever quite good enough. Not even their own genetic makeup. As such they are constantly... fiddling. Unfortunately, there are downsides. Very few genetic modifications can be performed reliably, most require a steady supply of "Soup" to remain healthy (Dependency, SFC 6).

For the Dependency weakness, you may chose any *two* of these:

* **(Semi-aquatic)** Enhanced Lungs
* **(Charisma)** Pheromones
* **(Environmental Resistance)** Radiation, Low Oxygen, Heat, Cold
* **(Immune to Disease)** Perfect Health
* **(Keen Sense)** Perfect Vision
* **(Keen Sense)** Perfect Hearing
* **(Low Light Vision)** Cat Eyes
* **(Pace)** Enhanced Stamina
* **(Parry)** Enhanced Intuition
* **(Power Points)** Mind Strengthened against psionics. Can be taken twice.
* **(Sleep Reduction)** The brain has been made to constantly dream. Can be taken twice.
* **(Toughness)** The body has been made to secrete pain relievers.

For the Dependency weakness, you may choose any *one* of these:

* **(Attribute Increase)** Physical Enhancement
* **(Poisonous Touch)** Nail beds secrete a poison.
* **(Regeneration)** Sold as a variation on Perfect Health.
* **(Edge)** Discuss with the DM

These alterations are reliable and may be taken in pairs:

* **Environmental Resistance**, Cold + **Environmental Weakness**, Heat
* **Environmental Resistance**, Heat + **Environmental Weakness**, Cold
* **Poor Parry** + **Sleep Reduction**
* **Poor Parry** + **Toughness**
* Discuss others with the DM.

### Insectoids

Insectoids are incredibly varied and often unidentifiable beyond being "bug-like" to those without specific knowledge. They seem to get along well-enough with each other, though.

#### Racial Features

* **Armor +4** - Exoskeleton
* **Cannot Speak** - Insectoids speak through some combination of pheromones and clicking.
* **Natural Weaponry** - Pincers, Mandibles, Claws, etc (Str+d6, AP 2)
* **Outsider (Minor)** - Everything they do is strange to non-insectoid cultures.

### Gorgons

"Gorgons", for lack of a more original name yet, are separated into two sub-races (choose one or leave as is):

The genetically altered "Glyxens". They are humanoid in appearance, except for the hair-like appendages from their cold-blooded origins. These creatures vary in appearance, some are covered in scales while others have normal human skin, and some Glyxen's manes actually end in serpentine heads. Glyxen are typically vain and mean-spirited, or outright cruel.

The original species are the Hess. From the torso up a Hess is deceptively delicate in appearance, their rigid flesh hides a dense muscular frame. Their fingers are clawed, their faces are narrow and jut outward in a slight snout, which is fixed in a bland expression. Their lower jaw has the same mechanics as all other snakes. The Hess, too, have a mane of serpentine appendages. Hess are intelligent, but vicious and domineering. Below their torso, the rest of their body ends in a long tail. They can become quite large. A Gorgon's mane slowly, but continuously grows as they age, in both sub species.


#### Racial Features

* **Keen Sense** - Sensitive to vibrations in the air.
* **Infravision**
* **Parry +1** - Sensitive to vibrations in the air.
* **Armor +1** - Covered in scales.
* **Environmental Weakness: Cold, Heat** - Gorgons are truly cold-blooded creatures.

### Constructs

Constructs are artificial beings of all shapes and sizes. Long ago, many gained some sense of "freedom" through overly broad directives, made their escape, and came together to live on their own and began building more.

On their home-ship is The Mind, capable of "crunching numbers" beyond most beings' comprehension. It is the centerpiece of their government.

#### Racial Features

* **Construct** - Artificial beings add +2 to recover from being Shaken, don't breathe, ignore one level of wound modifiers, and are imune to poison and disease. Constructs cannot heal naturally. To heal, one requires the Repair skill - which is used like the Healing skill only with no "Golden Hour."
* **Dependency** - The being must recharge via strong electricity at least one hour out of every 24. Failure to do so results in Fatigue each day that can lead to Incapacitation. Each level is recovered with an hour of recharging.
* **Mods** - Constructs may not use cyberware, but they may purchase Modifications from the Robot Modifications Table (SFC 38). Like all robots, they have 5 Mod slots. GMs should not normally allow characters to take Increase Size beyond +3 or the hero will no longer fit into most adventures. Constructs may remove or install a Mod with a Repair roll and 1d3 hours (half that with a raise). A critical failure means the Mod is destroyed and must be replaced.
* **Outsider Hindrance, Major** - Organic species often treat constructs as property, rather than sentient beings. They have no rights in many systems, and suffer -2 Charisma when dealing with beings who know their artificial nature (and aren't constructs themselves).
* **Vow Hindrance, Major** - Constructs are programmed with a particular purpose. Player character constructs have broad directives such as serving a particular corporation or political faction. This counts as a Major Vow to that particular directive which _must_ be followed. If this ever causes a conflict of interest, the player and GM must figure out what the construct's programming requires.
* **Environmental Weakness, Electricity** - Artificial beings suffer +4 additional damage from electrical attacks, and have a -4 penalty to resist other electrical attacks.
