## Humans

As humanity's influence expanded, the influence of the original governing bodies weakened. Eventually, the principal governments of the original planets lost the power to enforce order far beyond their own system. Now, it is largely left to corporations to protect their own interests.

For those not falling under the umbrella of a corporation, there is lawlessness, or there is the Federation.

### The Federation

The Federation operates more like a swarm of hired guns than any sort of governing agency.

## Constructs

Constructs operate primarily on a strict set of logic when it comes to governance. As such, there is little internal conflict. _The Mind_ handles "crunching the numbers" when it comes to larger decisions, and Constructs largely abide by its decisions.

## Gorgons

Organized under a system of Social Darwinism, they tend to operate in "tribes" and follow the lead of the "strongest" among them, as determined by wildly varying shows of strength.

The tribes do not get along particularly well, but may form (and dissolve!) alliances as suits them.
